# Pacman AI – Search Algorithms (Academic Project)

## Context
This repository contains an academic implementation based on the
UC Berkeley Pacman AI framework. The project was used as a learning
support to understand and experiment with classical search algorithms
in artificial intelligence.

## Learning objectives
The main goal of this project was to study and apply fundamental AI
search techniques in a controlled game environment, including:

- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search
- Heuristic design and evaluation

## Technical focus
- State-space search and graph traversal
- Path cost management
- Heuristic functions and admissibility
- Separation between game engine and agent logic
- Understanding the impact of algorithms on agent behavior

## Attribution
The original Pacman AI framework was developed by UC Berkeley and is
used here strictly for educational purposes.

## Personal contribution
My work focused on analyzing the architecture of the framework and
implementing search-based agent behaviors to better understand how
classical AI algorithms operate in practice within a dynamic environment.
